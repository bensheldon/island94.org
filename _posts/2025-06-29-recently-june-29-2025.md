- We have a new fridge; it is the same model as the old fridge because only that model would fit in the cabinetry. The installers also discovered that the water valve was broken and couldn't be shut off; subsequently, the plumber determined that only the handle had snapped. I ordered a completely new water valve to unscrew its handle and attach that handle to the existing valve. In this economy.
- This week in Rails, I went back and replaced most of the places I was using turbo-broadcast-refresh and replaced them with targeted turbo-streams. I also spent a bunch of time trying to make an autogrowing textfield that didn't bounce the page up and down which the `style.height = auto; style.height = scrollHeight`-strategy does with Bootstrap; this was [the result](https://gist.github.com/bensheldon/c68fbc7e7962bde5860ab4b5700585bb).
- I'm committed to RubyMine Junie over Cursor for AI-assisted coding. I think Cursor does ever-so-slightly better with generated code and the prompting UI, but RubyMine is so far beyond for everything else. I keep sharing this on Reddit, so here's [my agent guidelines](https://gist.github.com/bensheldon/b4fd84f9880b05ae57521beb1297e3a2) that I symlink into wherever the tool wants it.
- I'm still reading _The Future of Another Timeline_. And I started playing Satisfactory.
