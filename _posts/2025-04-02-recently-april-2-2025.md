- I've been away from work for the past week hosting family, including a 9 and 11 year old. In that week, we did: Ferry Building Farmer's Market, Exploratorium and Tactile Dome, Alcatraz, "Dear San Francisco" at Club Fugazi, swam in the Bay and at the YMCA, rode a cable car, rode some buses, walked the Golden Gate Bridge, hiked Muir Woods, ate House of Prime Rib, Mama's, Fish, Tailor's Son, and Cafe de Casa. We had the kids for a night so their parent's could do Napa and overnight at Indian Springs. I dropped them off at the airport yesterday and it is blessedly quiet and cats are decompressing.
- For the kids we opened up The Big Bag of Quest Headsets that we have accumulated because Angelina works on them. Lots of charging and battery swapping and then Beat Saber. The kids also played _Threes_ and _Tiny Wings_ on iPhones.
- During downtime we watched through "Wolf King", and I got to provide adult commentary of "do you think _they_ are a werelord?" about everyone; I had fun.
- I finished reading _Wicked_; I won't be doing the trilogy. I recluctantly started reading _Polostan_; the past several Neal Stephenson books have not been my thing but I am a suffering optimist.
- I started playing _Anodyne_. Please suggest casual uncomplicated metroidvanias and open-world wander-arounders.
