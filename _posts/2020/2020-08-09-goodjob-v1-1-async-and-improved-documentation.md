[GoodJob](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job) version 1.1 has been released. GoodJob is a multithreaded, Postgres-based, ActiveJob backend for Ruby on Rails. If you’re new to GoodJob, read the [introductory blog post](https://island94.org/2020/07/introducing-goodjob-1-0).

GoodJob’s v1.1 release contains a new, economical execution mode called "async" to execute jobs within the webserver process with the same reliability as a separate job worker process. 

This release also contains more in-depth documentation based on feedback and questions I've received since the v1.0 release. 

Version 1.1 comes out 3 weeks after GoodJob v1.0. The initial release of GoodJob was featured on [Ruby Weekly](https://rubyweekly.com/issues/511), [A Fresh Cup](https://web.archive.org/web/20200810221115/https://afreshcup.com/home/2020/07/30/double-shot-2651)

, [Awesome Ruby](https://ruby.libhunt.com/newsletter/219), and was as high as #8 on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23928891). GoodJob has since received nearly [500 stars on Github](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job). 

## Async mode
In addition to the `$ good_job` executable, GoodJob now can execute jobs inside the webserver process itself. For light workloads and simple applications, combining web and worker into a single process is very economical, especially when running on Heroku's free or hobby plans. 

GoodJob's async execution is compatible with Puma, in multithreaded (`RAILS_MAX_THREADS`), multi-process (`WEB_CONCURRENCY`), and memory efficient `preload_app!` configurations. GoodJob is built with Concurrent Ruby which offers excellent thread and process-forking safety guarantees. Read the [GoodJob async documentation](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job#executing-jobs-async--in-process) for more details. 

On a personal level, I’m very excited to have this feature in GoodJob. Async execution was _the_ compelling reason I had previously adopted Que, another Postgres-based backend, in multiple projects and I was heartbroken when [Que dropped support for async execution](https://github.com/que-rb/que/issues/238#issuecomment-480648845).

## Improved documentation
Since GoodJob was released 3 weeks ago, the documentation has been significantly expanded. It contains more code and examples for ensuring reliability and handling job errors. I've had dozens of people ask questions through [Github Issues](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/issues) and [Ruby on Rails Link Slack](https://www.rubyonrails.link).

## Upcoming
In the next release, v1.2, I plan to simplify the creation of multiple dedicated threadpools within a single process. The goal is to provide an economical solution to congestion when the execution of a number of slow, low-priority jobs (elephants) are being performed and there are no execution resources available for newly introduced fast, high priority jobs (mice) until the currently executing elephants complete. 

A proposed configuration, for example:

`--queues=mice:2,elephants:4`

...would allocate 2 dedicated threads for jobs enqueued on the mice queue, and 4 threads for the elephants queue. Learn more in the [feature's Github Issue](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/issues/45).

## Contribute
GoodJob continues to be enjoyable to develop and build upon Rails' ActiveJob and Concurrent Ruby. Contributions are welcomed: check out the [GoodJob Backlog](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/projects/1), comment on or open a Github Issue, or make a Pull Request.
