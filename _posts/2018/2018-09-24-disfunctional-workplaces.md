title: Disfunctional workplaces

I've found too many opportunities to quote this from ["Ask a Manager"](https://www.askamanager.org/2018/09/how-can-i-brace-myself-for-my-toxic-new-job.html) in the past few weeks:

> ...one of the ways that dysfunctional workplaces harm the people who work there is by warping their sense of what’s normal … and by getting them overly invested in trying to make something work that they aren’t well positioned to fix in any meaningful way.
