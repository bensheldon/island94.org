From China Mieville's _October: The Story of the Russian Revolution_:

> To be a radical was to lead others, surely, to change their ideas, to persuade them to follow you; to go neither too far or too fast, nor to lag behind. 'To patiently explain.' How easy to forget that people do not need or await permission to move.
