<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>What's really changed?</th>
      <th>What should you do?</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Broader impact horizon</strong>: There is a broader range of issues, people, and ideas to focus on.</td>
      <td>Balance depth and breadth</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Greater complexity and ambiguity</strong>: There are more variables, and there is greater uncertainty about outcomes.</td>
      <td>Delegate more deeply.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Tougher organization politics</strong>: There are more powerful stakeholders to contend with.</td>
      <td>Influence differently.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Further from the front lines</strong>: There is greater distance between you and the people executing on the ground, potentially weakening communication and adding more filters.</td>
      <td>Communicate more formally.</td>
    </tr>
          <tr>
      <td><strong>More scrutiny</strong>: There is more attention paid to your actions by more people, more frequently.</td>
      <td>Adjust to greater visibility.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
