It’s possible to programmatically upload images to GitHub Issues, Pull Requests and Comments via automation. Finally, though maybe mistakenly, I dunno.

It’s fairly well known that for the longest time, [GitHub has not had a programmatic interface for uploading images and attachments](https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/1895). It’s possible in the browser, by dragging-and-dropping your image, but not via something you can script or curl. That’s been a bummer for lots of GitHub Action-powered systems you might imagine, like: automatically attaching demo screenshots or videos on PRs for new features, or attaching failure screenshots or visual diffs from browser tests.

Until now, I guess. Here’s the unofficial, undocumented endpoint:

```shell
FILE=cat.jpg
MIME=image/jpeg
REPOSITORY=bensheldon/good_job
TOKEN=$(gh auth token)

curl -s "https://uploads.github.com/user-attachments/assets?name=$FILE&content_type=$MIME&repository_id=$(gh api "repos/$REPOSITORY" --jq .id)" \
  -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" --data-binary "@$FILE"

# that outputs a JSON response containing the attachment URL, which you can then embed in an image tag into the GitHub content.
```

That’s it! I mean, you can be more clever than curl or whatever, but that's the idea. It's equivalent to dragging-and-dropping an image into an Issue, PR, or Comment.

I don’t know if this endpoint always accepted an Auth Token and no one tried or noticed or talked about it, or if that’s new. My memory was that this endpoint _only_ previously accepted Cookie Auth: circa 2018 I explored different Visual Diff services and the lack of a programmatic API for GitHub attachments meant that to DIY you’d have to use a service like S3, and then a service to authorize S3, and that's annoying to set up when GitHub Actions could do everything else. I’m pretty sure I tried to fuzz the attachment interface at the time and it didn’t work.

I recently learned all of this was possible because [Justin Gordon of Shakacode](https://shakacode.com/) shared a link to [Intercom’s 2x-skills `attach-github-assets`](https://github.com/intercom/2x-skills/blob/59213af0a2db9321ef10355ff24e9bd619151b6b/plugins/pr-tools/skills/attach-github-assets/SKILL.md) and I was... skeptical... and then I tried it and it worked!

It's very useful, I hope it doesn't go away.
