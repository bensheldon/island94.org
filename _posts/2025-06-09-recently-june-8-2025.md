Big business news for my startup: ["Frontdoor Benefits Receives $2.1 Million Investment to Improve Access to SNAP and Public Assistance Programs"](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/frontdoor-benefits-receives-2-1-million-investment-to-improve-access-to-snap-and-public-assistance-programs-302472695.html). My cofounder Charlotte also [added some details on our blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20250613140457/https://frontdoorbenefits.substack.com/p/the-connecticut-project-invests-21m) too. Big milestone, and onto the next milestone and so forth.

We went to a Golden State Valkyries basketball game last week. It was a lot of fun, and a _nice_ seat was the cost of a substantially-less-nice seat to see the Golden State Warriors. We bought sweatshirts, so that means we're going back.

On sports, since my last _Recently_ we also went to two Giants games and a Warriors game (whomp whomp).

Of random technical trivia, I discovered a cause of flaky tests: Turbo-Rails debounces broadcast refreshes and it's possible for them to slip out of test transactions and cause chaos. I have [reported it](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails/issues/731).

Also, my prior-colleague Issy wrote a nice thing [and mentioned me](https://ruby.social/@issyl0/114489859415578145).

I finished reading Martha Well's reissued _The Emilie Adventures_, which for all her books held my attention the least. I also read Brittany Newell's _Soft Core_ which was very good. I'm now reading _The Future of Another Timeline_. 

For nonfiction, I (re-) read the updated edition of _The Strategy is Delivery_. And now I'm greatly enjoying Rouse's _Game Design: Theory and Practice (2nd Edition)_ which I found because it was referenced in the [Digital Antiquarian's history of the Sierra studio](https://www.filfre.net/2025/05/the-end-of-sierra-as-we-knew-it-part-4-chainsaw-monday/).

I beat the game [Yoku's Island Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoku%27s_Island_Express), which was a delightful experience on my desired theme of nice metroidvania (recommendations please). I also just started [Season 2 of Playdate](https://play.date/games/seasons/two/), which was a reason to find and charge it. On the theme of small handhelds, I ordered an [Adafruit USB C Resistor Fixer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6323) (say that 5 times fast) for the RGB30 that was collecting dust until I discovered some Pico 8 games I'd like to play.
