- I am on a new work adventure. I gave my notice at GitHub and will be doing [this](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/experience/news-history/charlotte-weiner-mba-24-opening-door-billions-unclaimed-public-benefits)  full-time starting in April. The new job should be a nice combination of a cozy “this again” and some thrilling new.
- I finished reading _Careless People_; recommend as a good sequence of business  trainwrecks that will leave you wondering if _this one_ is penultimate trainwreck (spoiler: it’s not). Now I’m reading _Wicked_; I didn’t really like the beginning but it’s gotten more interesting. 
- I finished _Severance_. Hopefully without spoilers, the consistent plot driver seems to be “Mark (yes) sucks”. So now just _White Lotus_ and with palate cleansers of _Say Yes to the Dress_. 
- I have been desultorily playing [Bracket City](https://bracket.city/); the scoring system generates no motivation for me but it’s fun to have found another use for the decades spent training my brain to parse deeply nested hierarchical syntax. I was also told that LinkedIn has games, and other than being “Faster than 95% of CEOs” at Queens, I have already lost my streak.
- I asked on Rails Performance Slack how to better delegate Rails model association accessors and got [some good ideas](https://gist.github.com/bensheldon/2075bf807277697681c69f382fc96e9c). 
- My [RailsConf session proposal](https://ruby.social/@bensheldon/114082492378628679) was accepted! See you there 🙌
