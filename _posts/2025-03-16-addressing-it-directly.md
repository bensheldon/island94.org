Lost to time in my Code for America email was a list of reasons why deferring to software engineers can be problematic. It included this theme, from Will Larson's ["Building personal and organizational prestige"](https://lethain.com/building-prestige/$0):

<blockquote markdown="1">

In my experience, engineers confronted with a new problem often leap to creating a system to solve that problem rather than addressing it directly. I’ve found this particularly true when engineers approach a problem domain they don’t yet understand well, including building prestige.

For example, when an organization decides to invest into its engineering brand, the initial plan will often focus on project execution. It’ll include a goal for publishing frequency, ensuring content is representationally accurate across different engineering sub-domains, and how to incentivize participants to contribute. If you follow the project plan carefully, you will technically have built an engineering brand, but my experience is that it’ll be both more work and less effective than a less systematic approach.

Sometimes you just do stuff.
