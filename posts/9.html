<p><em>I recently lost access to my 10-year old Code for America email address when I changed jobs. I tried to preserve some of the good stuff and this is one story.</em></p>

<p>During my time as a Code for America Fellow in 2012, I created a Javascript-based slippy map tile renderer called <a href="https://github.com/nodetiles/nodetiles-core">NodeTiles</a> (kinda sorta like Mapnik). Several colleagues helped vastly expand it, we presented at NACIS, and I know of at least one successful company that is still powered by forked version of it today.</p>

<p><strong>Jessica</strong></p>

<p>During our Fellowship, Jessica Lord gave a tech talk on building custom map tiles and first introduced me to TileMill. I couldn‚Äôt find a record in my email of when that happened, but know she planted this seed üå±</p>

<p><strong>Tom</strong></p>

<p>On April 25, 2012, I sent this email to Tom Carden:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This week I came across a gist of yours and eventually made my way to nodemap while researching how to generate server-side map tiles. Thank you so much for putting those pieces together; they‚Äôre fantastic! I matched your code with node-canvas-heroku to get it running in the cloud and it‚Äôs pretty fantastic:</p>

  <p><a href="http://morning-spring-2292.herokuapp.com/">http://morning-spring-2292.herokuapp.com/</a></p>

  <p>Anyways, just wanted to send you a big thanks for the code and inspiration. I‚Äôm working on building a node-based utfgrid renderer to bootstrap an entire wax interaction layer‚Ä¶ all without Mapnik (though maybe I should just work on packaging that for Heroku).</p>

  <p>Cheers,<br />
Ben</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tom gave some helpful advice and caveat emptor about JS performance and data caching. He continued to follow up with node-canvas and cairo suggestions for getting stuff running on Heroku. Tom ended up being a Code for America mentor for a different project and he was the source of us using the Toner map style in demos and also a nice leaflet clustering plugin.</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>

<p>Rob Brackett was the first person I explained what I was doing to create a tile render in Javascript. His reaction to my explanation was ‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you talking about?‚Äù Rob is one of my best friends, and I don‚Äôt remember how I explained what would become Nodeiles initially, but I‚Äôm sure it took 20 minutes and was a non-linear train of thought.</p>

<p>On May 2, 2012, I sent this email to ‚ÄúFuzz‚Äù, Code for America‚Äôs random-nerdsnipe list:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Last week Rob and I built a heroku-compatible map-tile renderer (and UTFGrid generator)¬†that can quickly (and with low bandwidth/client-processing) serve¬†interactive maps and markers comprising tens of thousands of points¬†and polygons‚Äîand unlike TileMill, the final map can be connected to¬†a live database and updated on-the-fly. It‚Äôs kind‚Äôve badass.</p>

  <p>Here are 2 examples:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Static map of San Francisco streets and Parks:¬†
 <a href="http://morning-spring-2292.herokuapp.com/">http://morning-spring-2292.herokuapp.com/</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Map of all ~1.5k Occupy sites worldwide (I did this in about 15min, so it‚Äôs a little clunky):
 <a href="http://occupy-map.herokuapp.com/">http://occupy-map.herokuapp.com/</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>In terms of why it‚Äôs badass (from less to more geeky):</p>

  <ol>
    <li>It‚Äôs fast. Nothing is rendered in the browser, instead all of the tiles are rendered and streamed to the browser as PNGs.</li>
    <li>It‚Äôs small. No shapefiles are sent to the browser. Each Map (the entire initial pageload) is less than 500kb.</li>
    <li>It can do dynamic data. TileMill makes beautiful maps, but once you export them to MapBox (or your own mbtile server), you can‚Äôt change them. This can be hooked up to a live database (right now it parses geojson).</li>
    <li>It runs on Heroku. It uses node-canvas (not Mapnik) so it is fast, lightweight and has few dependencies.</li>
    <li>It renders UTFGrids, which can provide mouse-hovers and other straightforward UI stuff that most maps don‚Äôt (way less clicky)</li>
    <li>It‚Äôs not a tileserver, it‚Äôs a tile <em>renderer</em>. Seriously, all those maptiles are being generated on on-the-fly (we should probably cache them, but hey, this is bleeding edge)</li>
    <li>It‚Äôs nodejs and all the code is on Github:¬† <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/nodetiles">https://github.com/bensheldon/nodetiles</a> ¬†</li>
  </ol>

  <p>I‚Äôm still working on it, so if you have a big dataset that you‚Äôve had trouble mapping before, let me know since I‚Äôm looking for more/better use cases.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Prashant</strong></p>

<p>Prashant Singh, another Code for America fellow, was excited about the project and gave me lots of feedback. Prashant was using my project to generate large static maps from the commandline, and he gave some feedback on his experience doing similar work with Mapnik. Prashant and two other Fellows, Alicia Rouault and Matt Hampel, would subsequently build a business on top of it.</p>

<p>On June 5, 2012 I sent this email to Eric Gundersen at Mapbox:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>I haven‚Äôt done a big writeup yet. I‚Äôm hoping to submit to NACIS for their October conference, but I‚Äôm still trying to clean up the code, modularize it, and write tests and documentation.</p>

  <p>General backstory: I had been playing around a lot with TileMill and Mapnik and trying to programmatically generate map tiles; at CfA we have a lot of big, dynamic data and I was trying to set up an automated tile renderer. Then I came across a Tom Carden project where he was use Node-Canvas to render tiles‚Ä¶ and then I discovered a node-canvas module that would run on Heroku‚Ä¶ and by that point I was in love with the idea of a low-dependency (compared to mapnik) on-the-fly tile rendering implementation.</p>

  <p>From there, I wanted to see how close I could get to a full-blown TileJSON implementation. I had my coworker Rob Brackett write me a Javascript UTFGrid implementation and I hooked that up to the tile rasterizer. And bam. It‚Äôs clunky as hell, and sort‚Äôve slow (it‚Äôs rendering an entire shapefile then cropping it down for every tile rather than spatially indexing the features), but I think it has potential.¬†</p>

  <p>I think the next step (in addition to cleanup and documentation) is loading up some OSM metro data and actually seeing how the performance compares to Mapnik. Also, while I can‚Äôt foresee implementing something like Cascadenik, node-canvas gives you direct access to the graphics renderer and it might be useful for creating boutique maps with graphical flourishes that Mapnik hasn‚Äôt implemented‚Ä¶ and of course for creating layers with dynamic data.</p>

  <p>Let me know if you have any specific questions or ideas you‚Äôd like me to try to implement or use as demos. Thanks for the interest!</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Alex</strong></p>

<p>Alex Yule, another Code for America Fellow, and an actual experienced cartographer, was also interested. Alex would build a proper database adapter layer and the actual spatial indexing functionality that all of my previous emails yolo. Alex joined Rob and my presentation proposal at NACIS. This was our abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NodeTiles: Joyful Map Tile Rendering with Node.js</strong></p>

  <p>Mapnik has become the de facto open-source standard for rendering map tiles. While Mapnik is extremely powerful, it can be difficult to set up and deploy. We present NodeTiles, a lightweight, JavaScript-based, open-source map tile renderer that is easy to deploy, use, and extend. Built to support applications with dynamic data, NodeTiles offers an accessible and cloud-friendly alternative to Mapnik. While still in early-stage development, features on the road-map include styling with the CSS-based Carto language for compatibility with MapBox TileMill, UTFGrid generation for client-side interactivity, and data adaptors for PostGIS and Shapefiles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>NACIS</strong></p>

<p>The NACIS (North American Cartographic Information Society) conference was October 17-19, 2012 in Portland, Oregon. Alex and Rob and I had gotten an AirBnB and I mostly remember us doing a lot of last-minute implementing. Alex built a really nice Postgres Adapter plugin and Rob was reimplementing Cascadenik (‚ÄúCSS for Maps‚Äù) somewhere between Javascript and Cairo; there was a deep-dive into blitting. We presented at a breakout called ‚ÄúSlippy Maps‚Äù.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I remember riding BART back from the airport when we arrived home in San Francisco. I was talking with a maybe-a-big-deal person from the map-tech community, and they asked me something pointed like ‚ÄúBut how much did <strong>you</strong> <em>really</em> contribute to NodeTiles?‚Äù I said something like ‚ÄúIt was a team effort‚Äù and then it got really quiet. In hindsight that was probably a job interview. And also fuck that, it <em>was</em> a team effort.</p>

<p><strong>That‚Äôs it</strong></p>

<p>During Fall of 2012 Code for America Fellowship was ending and interviewing as an inexperienced engineer is freaking hard (and also incredibly dumb, but those are different stories). So I mostly put down NodeTiles. And also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Going from something that‚Äôs a tech demo to something understandable (‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you talking about‚Äù) and usable by outsiders is hard.</li>
  <li>The sheer difficulty of spatial work. That dumb NodeTiles logo took me hours just to get the tooling together to just like, draw straight lines on a globe to say ‚ÄúNODETILES‚Äù.</li>
  <li>Maps are a commodity, and also if you need to dynamically map a billion+ polyons (I‚Äôve been informed that today there is Postgres MVT) <em>and</em> you need a pipeline for auth and anti-scrape and billing and raster and‚Ä¶. well, god bless you.</li>
  <li>I leaned into some questionable architectural decisions to make NodeTiles more Javascripty, splitting up the front and backends, and modularizing all the different pieces into their own packages. In hindsight that was a lot of valueless work that only introduced friction into building the tool and delivering the value. That‚Äôs on me; never forget.</li>
  <li>Given that this is an email-based retrospective, I will admit I found some emails from kinda big deals like Stamen that I didn‚Äôt respond to. I dunno why I didn‚Äôt respond; probably burnout. If that was you, it wasn‚Äôt personal, and I‚Äôm happy with the path I‚Äôve taken, and I hope you are too ü§ó</li>
</ul>

<p>NodeTiles is <a href="https://github.com/nodetiles">still up on GitHub</a>. If you can get node-canvas linking to cairo (memories of this seems like a fever dream), NodeTiles is really cool. Maybe you‚Äôll do something neat with Nodetiles ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/bensheldon/bridging-people-and-benefits-systems">my presentation of how my small engineering team helped deliver food stamps to millions of Californians</a>, I talked about a common pathology of engineers: a desire to build the equivalent of thousand-year clocks that will run self-contained without human intervention. You see it crop up in different forms, the good ways of ‚Äúworking yourself out of a job‚Äù and the bad ways of platinum plating and astronaut architects.</p>

<p>And I‚Äôve become become aware of that pathology affecting how engineers perceive the labor of <em>other people</em>: they don‚Äôt, not the people part. And that‚Äôs bad.</p>

<p>To be fair, not seeing the people isn‚Äôt just an engineering pathology. We talk about products, and services, and value, and how<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tedchiang/the-real-danger-to-civilization-isnt-ai-its-runaway#.spxyjARZP"> capitalist corporations are simply slow AI</a>. And I‚Äôve been working with a leadership coach and spending a fair bit of time contemplating what it means to do something larger than myself but within the realm of human endeavour.  So please go with me here.</p>

<p>Platforms.  I‚Äôve spent a lot of my career working on X-as-a-Platform. Which is the idea that it‚Äôs a <em>good thing</em> if the things in our lives become analogous to vending machines, or FedEx status pages: we press the button on the machine, and we get what we want, and if not now, then the machine will tell us exactly when.</p>

<p>But this idea of platforms, the machine, break down when the machine‚Ä¶ breaks down, or just changes. When the <em>good</em> sandwich cookies are out, or they get replaced with the <em>bad</em> sandwich cookies, or when there are no sandwich cookies at all because it‚Äôs Tuesday morning and deliveries normally happen on Monday and Monday was a holiday. Then we‚Äôre confronted with a reality: you, and I, and the people who stock the machine, and build the machine, and the people who make the decisions about what to stock it with, or when, and how, and why‚Ä¶.</p>

<p>We are all simply harried, overworked bags of dirty water that are winging it and doing our best balancing conflicting business needs, and complicated lives and health and families and concerns and motivations completely unrelated to the <em>good</em> sandwich cookies and your obtaining them. I‚Äôm sorry.</p>

<p>We can agree: it sure would be nice if the machine had the sandwich cookies you wanted.</p>

<p>Or not: my agreement could also be the pathology talking. The machine is not the human endeavor here‚Ä¶ though my sympathy for your situation (and our shared pathology) could be.</p>

<p>This particular line of thought was triggered by reading this passage from James Bennet‚Äôs <a href="https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2022/jul/11/pypi/">‚ÄúYes, I have opinions on your open source contributions‚Äù</a>  about some drama going on around the situation of the people who run the PyPI Python package repository wanting to add additional security requirements on the people who publish packages to said repository to protect the people who download packages from said repository and thus reduce support demand on said repository maintainers by preventing packages from being compromised (analogus some drama is playing out in my world of Ruby too):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you believe nobody has the right to ‚Äùdemand‚Äù an open-source maintainer do something or abide by some policy or restriction, then that ends the argument in more ways than people are appreciating. If you just want to say ‚Äúnobody can demand I do this‚Äù, then OK, but you also can‚Äôt demand PyPI ‚Äî which is an open-source project, too ‚Äî do any particular thing or abide by any particular policy you‚Äôd like, which more or less removes any grounds you might have had to criticize their account security approach. They don‚Äôt owe you anything and don‚Äôt have to do what you want them to do, the end.</p>

  <p>But a lot of people in comment threads are trying really hard to figure out a way to impose requirements and standards on PyPI‚Äôs maintainers but not on anyone else, which then contradicts the ‚Äúit‚Äôs open-source, you can‚Äôt demand anyone do anything‚Äù basis of the whole argument. Somewhat amusing are people who try to argue that PyPI has a lot more power to affect people and so should be restricted more, which is an equally good argument for imposing on people who maintain major packages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there‚Äôs a lot more.</p>

<p>To follow my thread of before, there‚Äôs a lot of demanding going on that the people, who are inseparable from the package repository, be vending machines. And what, to me, sounds like a fair and reasonable counterpoint being that people are not vending machines. And we should go with that.</p>

    <p>Two quotes about the experience of life. The first from NYT‚Äôs Magazine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/magazine/weight-loss-pandemic.html">‚ÄúI‚Äôve Always Struggled With My Weight. Losing It Didn‚Äôt Mean Winning.<br />
‚Äú</a></p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Suddenly, I was slim. It was, by any measure, an incredible weight-loss success story. Even my great friend Alan texted about how good I looked. (‚ÄúDid I say that?‚Äù he wrote, with a facepalm emoji, when I reminded him of the time he squeezed my love handles. ‚ÄúSam, I was very inappropriate. But I still think it‚Äôs funny.‚Äù) I had achieved the great transformation ‚Äî I had turned myself into the ‚ÄúAFTER‚Äù photo.</p>

  <p>And now that we have that out of the way, I can tell you what I consider the most interesting thing about my weight-loss journey, a secret that you will never see in any banner ad. As the months passed, as I stuck with my healthful habits and got used to my new trim body, as the line on my Noom weight graph stayed low, I felt something amazing: I felt pretty much exactly as I had always felt my whole entire life. I was, after all that change, still only myself. My big epiphany, if I could put it into words, would be something like: ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And the second from Gawker‚Äôs <a href="https://www.gawker.com/culture/failure-to-cope-under-capitalism">‚ÄòFailure to cope ‚ÄúUnder capitalism‚Äù‚Äô</a> (newlines added by me for emphasis):</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>[Anne Helen] Petersen‚Äôs most acute insight is perhaps in identifying a link between relentlessly optimized childhoods designed to prevent downward mobility, and the professionally competent but profoundly enervated millennials overwhelmed by the prospect of canceling plans, of keeping plans, of cooking food, of texting their mothers. I think she is correct.</p>

  <p>I think it‚Äôs possible that for many, considering the shape of your life and then living it with vigor is so difficult because it cannot be externally validated. Unlike education and work, it offers no socially obvious meritocratic path. The moments where, like sourdough, it proves, are largely invisible ‚Äî in cooking, in walking, corresponding with a friend, in chatting with a neighbor or registering to give blood. They cannot be tallied up and put on a resume. They are never ‚Äúfinished.‚Äù The progress you make is spiraling rather than linear; circling steadily, slowly, around your weak points, taking two steps forward and one step back, building habits so slowly that only in retrospect can you see your life become different than it was. And there is no one who can tell you that you did it right.</p>

  <p>But this is not the condition of life under capitalism, this is life itself. And it is a sad irony that though the fear of life may be produced by class imperatives within capitalism, the impulse to restrict it to a problem of capitalism is itself part of the same fearful rejection of the task of living.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Which also reminds me of an aside from a Bruno book, whose authorship is an American author writing about contemporary Southern France, that the French are tryhards even when contributing to a weekly dinner at home with their friends.</p>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two months! In my last update I wrote about an overwhelming sense of normalcy. That has continued, in a good way.</p>

<p>I am making good pace at completing my Engineering Manager bingo card. So far I have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Worked with team and directors to write out quarterly OKRs, and close out the previous quarters</li>
  <li>Gone through (well, shadowed) the half-yearly performance review process</li>
  <li>Worked with a report through their departure from the team</li>
  <li>Participated in the candidate interview loop, though not yet as a hiring manager</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="something-im-inspired-by">Something I‚Äôm inspired by</h3>

<p>Writing OKRs with my team, boss, grandboss, and peer managers has been really, really, nice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>My team has been open within the OKR writing process, and creative, and participatory. I fumbled a bit trying to design an async but consensus Enthusiasm/Complexity matrix, but it‚Äôs been a great resource for me to understand the backlog and the team‚Äôs interests.</li>
  <li>My boss and grandboss have been understated , but driving the importance of OKRs. I‚Äôve particularly appreciate them say ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get it right, but it‚Äôs also just a Google Doc and we can change it‚Äù</li>
  <li>My peer managers as bar raisers in the process. We write OKRs for the department within the same document and I‚Äôve appreciated getting comments and questions about consistency and measurements and categorizations.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think planning is a fun challenge, with the two things that I focus on being:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strategic Planning vs Operational Planning. In my sideline as a strategic planning consultant, separating out these threads is <em>the work</em>.</li>
  <li>Team participation. I wasn‚Äôt surprised that participatory OKR planning was a stretch. At my previous jobs it‚Äôs not uncommon to have coworkers go from griping about long participatory planning meetings, to then asking ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how the team prioritizes work.‚Äù Sometimes that can mean ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with what came out of planning‚Äù but it frequently can mean ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see <em>that</em> planning as the venue for what <em>I</em> want to advocate for.‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôm still uncomfortable writing essays in Slack, but I did write this for the team:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OKR thoughts: It might be interesting to explain how I view the OKRs in case it changes your feedback about them.</p>

  <p>I write OKRs is that they‚Äôre a summary of what the team wants to do, to be communicated upwards. And then we expect management/leadership to protect/fund those activities over the duration of the quarter.</p>

  <p>So they‚Äôre things that we believe (hopefully, feedback wanted) :</p>
  <ul>
    <li>we‚Äôre enthusiastic about doing (most importantly)</li>
    <li>AND we think we can reasonably accomplish during the quarter (maybe with a bit of stretch, but that should come from us)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>And then that gets sent upwards, and (usually, in my experience elsewhere) Leadership says ‚Äúgreat! let us know how we can help.‚Äù And if there is feedback, it‚Äôs usually of the form of ‚Äúdo you think this falls more into X or Y bucket?‚Äù (because they have to write their OKRs) and then maybe it‚Äôs a conversation. I‚Äôve seen Leadership start meddling when a team doesn‚Äôt put forward a confident set of objectives, not usually in opposition to them. They‚Äôre part of a team umbrella ‚òÇÔ∏è</p>

  <p>I have never seen OKRs be inflicted on a team; if it feels that way, I think that sucks. Hence why I‚Äôm wanting to explain my perspective in case that‚Äôs new.</p>

  <p>Bring thoughts to our Sync Meeting next Tuesday, or add them to the OKR chat above, or DM me.</p>

  <p>Thank you for coming to my TED Talk üòÉ</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="something-im-challenged-by">Something I‚Äôm challenged by</h3>

<p>One way you might design a performance review process is to combine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Evaluative feedback, simple quantitative metrics (does not meet, meets, exceeds) expectations, grounded against a career ladder or functional job description.</li>
  <li>Coaching and appreciation, qualitative narrative about past contributions and future opportunity and explains the gaps between the true work and the ideals of the career ladder.</li>
  <li>Unifying economic model for salary adjustments (and bonus, new to me) and promotions that answers what the company ‚Äúrecognizes‚Äù (‚Äúrecognition‚Äù  is how across my career I hear ICs talk about their perceived match between personal/team contributions and compensation/hierarchy)</li>
</ul>

<p>The challenge of these systems (like my essay on OKRs above) is keeping them simple enough to be transparent, while recognizing that the map is neither the landscape, nor the expedition. I think there is room for improvement in all things, and I haven‚Äôt yet seen any of the worst pathologies of my past (like a long ago director who pushed back against a transparent career ladder because of their fear people would ‚Äúgame it‚Äù). I‚Äôm hoping I remember all this 6 months from now when it kicks off again.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What‚Äôs next</h3>

<p>I get to see how the team executes on our OKRs and how our quarterly engineering rotation kicks off. I‚Äôm excited for both.</p>

    <p>The experience of learning about systemic racism in the US is a constant derailing of ‚Äúbut we can‚Äôt know the actual intent‚Äù; systemic sexism on the otherhand is ‚Äúoh, here are the receipts‚Äù. Which is not to discount the research and scholarship of author Mar Hicks, more just to say ‚Äúwow, there it is‚Äù.</p>

<p><em>Programmed Inequality</em> is focused on one particular aspect covered by the more surveyish <em>Recoding Gender</em>. To attempt to summarize a lot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take a systemic inequality, like the Marriage Bar, which made it unlawful for women to keep their job once they became married.</li>
  <li>Then it‚Äôs reasonable to imagine that managers will invest less time in training and developing women in the workplace.</li>
  <li>Then it‚Äôs reasonable to imagine that women are less likely to be promoted into management and leadership.</li>
  <li>Then it‚Äôs reasonable to imagine that women will be tracked into roles and functions that do not offer training or management potential.</li>
  <li>Then it‚Äôs reasonable to imagine that roles and functions will be designed and shaped around these constraints and will develop bureacratic inertia.</li>
  <li>Then it‚Äôs reasonable to imagine that other roles and functions (who happen to be men, because of the previous reasonable assertions) will be bureacratically competing for power and resources and prestige with those feminized roles and functions (and the women who fill them). And it will be ugly.</li>
  <li>Then it‚Äôs reasonable to imagine that, people being people, on human timescales with human constraints, and talent being equally distributed even when opportunity is not, they‚Äôll do their best to navigate and come to terms with it in different ways.</li>
</ul>

<p>It‚Äôs a book about an 80 year trainwreck. It has some interesting details about deskilling, and also about femininization: how expertise is reframed as ‚Äútemperment‚Äù.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although government reports referred to the great mass of their women workers as doing the ‚Äú monotonous toutine work‚Äù that made up the broad base of the Civil Service ‚Äúpyramid,‚Äù inquiries into the exact content and nature of machine operation commissioned by the Treasury itself repeatedly contradicted the characterizations of it as deskilled work.‚Äù These reports showed how machine workers needed many of the same skill sets as higher clerical workers and how machine operation jobs were best performed by higher-skill, more educated workers. Even machine workers at the lowest levels, who dealt with narrowly specialized calculations, possessed similar skills as clerical workers: ‚ÄúThe lower grades of the technical part of the engineering field and the scientific Assistants are both fairly close to the Clerical Class in many respects,‚Äù admitted an internal Treasury memo. Despite this, most women workers were now partitioned off from the higher-status clerical class. Eventually, the machine operator class would have three levels: The entry-level rung was the position of machine assistant. The middle rung of machine operator, took on more complex work. Women would rise to machine operator in their midtwenties. The top grade was senior machine operator. These women would perform the most complicated work in the class, including programming and systems analysis. The expectation was for women to attain that rank in their later twenties or early thirties, because at that point promotion and pay increases ceased‚Äìmuch earlier than for workers in clerical jobs. The structure of the new class enforced a shortened, dead-end career, partly because of the idea that women should leave by this point to get married and take care of a family, but also as a reflection of the low worth accorded to this work. Many Civil Service leaders in this era could not conceive of technical or machine-aided office work as interesting, as complex, or as providing preparation for higher work. The fact that the association of women with machine work in offices had initially evolved from women‚Äôs association with typewriteers helped reinforce this attitude. Yet the machine class was not simply a reflection of the status quo. It was the Treasury‚Äôs attempt to deal with rising numbers of women employees by reorganizing the government‚Äôs postwar workforce.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And surfaces a lot of stuff that‚Äôs seemingly baked into computing and labor relations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even before White Heat raised the profile of computing, a 1962 overview of government computing policy reported that the government hoped to recruit most programmers from the ranks of the seventy thousand workers in the executive class‚Äìthe management class of workers with A-level secondary school training, but without the university training of the higher administrative class or any particular skill set commonly associated with early programming expertise. Executive class officers dealt with long-term departmental goals and developed processes for greater efficiency. They were also overwhelmingly men. Paradoxically, these new recruits were thought to be more qualified for the technical aspects of computer jobs even though they lacked any machine experience. The tacit expectation was that higher-level civil servants would be more intelligent overall and therefore would have no trouble picking up supposedly lowly technical skills. A widespread belief persisted in government that work involving machines did not require much intellect. Yet the Treasury‚Äôs initial feelings that ‚Äúthe operation of computers was expected to be similar to that of punched card equipment and thus proper to SMOs [senior machine operators]‚Äù was giving way to the idea that computing jobs were actually too complex and required too much training to continue using feminized labor. ‚Äú Although a number of staff currently graded in the MO (Machine Operator) class are demonstrably suited to be computer operators,‚Äù opined one 1966 report, ‚Äúit must not be assumed that all machine operators capable of traditional responsibilities for that class have in fact ‚Äòoperating‚Äô ability.‚Äù</p>

  <p>This shift in attitude reflected the rigidity of the class hierarchies of the Civil Service. Even though government workers were supposed to be able to rise through the ranks meritocratically, by means of examinations, those in the lower classes of the service were often seen as fundamentally inferior to those at higher levels. As a result, there was little focus on grooming workers already in computer posts for higher positions. Instead ‚Äúbetter‚Äù workers would be brought in from the executive class and trained to do those jobs. Whether the nation was headed by Labor or the Conservatives, the highest administrators within the service remained relatively constant in their opinions about modernization within government. ‚ÄúIt was early on decided that for most programming orderical operations one did not need graduates in mathematics or other Growledge of professional standard, but a reasonable level of intelligence and certain aptitudes,‚Äù explained an organization specialist in the Treasury who authored a 1962 report titled ‚ÄúElectronic Computers Oil the Wheels of Government,‚Äù Management potential and a broad understanding of the workings of government agencies were the key qualities the Treasury now sought in computer workers.</p>

    <p>I just had my 1-month anniversary. The new job feels‚Ä¶. normal ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It‚Äôs 1:1s and sensemaking (dot-connecting, aligning, stortytelling) and gently holding and sharing and developing opinions about how people should collaborate in the worksplace and <em>engineering</em> the infrastructure that supports that.

<h2 id="something-im-inspired-by">Something I‚Äôm inspired by</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve observed a lot of reinforcement of goals and values. I‚Äôve been impressed seeing my team jump on an issue and not just say ‚ÄúI can help‚Äù but also ‚ÄúOur team‚Äôs purpose is to help.‚Äù Or seeing my Director hop in a comment and not just say ‚ÄúGreat work‚Äù but also ‚ÄúThis is a great example of our group‚Äôs charter‚Äù.</p>

<p>I think the majority of the feedback a manager should be giving is shining a spotlight on the things someone is already doing that are good and meaningful, and I‚Äôve been inspired to see that in action from others.</p>

<h2 id="something-im-thinking-about">Something I‚Äôm thinking about</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve been working through Lara Hogan‚Äôs <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/">‚ÄúQuestions for our first 1:1‚Äù</a>, which is part of my personal manager runbook.</p>

<p>The question ‚ÄúHow do you prefer to receive recognition?‚Äù gets spicy answers!  I‚Äôm managing a very high level team and the answers closely line up with my own high-level friends and high-level former coworkers and myself: people are <em>uncomfortable</em> with recognition.</p>

<p>Which is‚Ä¶ a not unreasonable reaction. In the words of a close friend ‚ÄúThis is total shit, but‚Ä¶ thanks, I‚Äôm glad you like it.‚Äù  When I think about my own reaction, I attribute it to navigating a lot of intersecting supremacy cultures (conscious and unconscious) which are complicated: perfectionism, humbleness, <a href="http://transmissionproject.org/current/2011/4/honest-practice-how-the-public-sector-can-look-at-itself-new-article-in-resources.html">honest practice</a>, a desire to recognize all contributors (which has its own recursive sympathy).</p>

<p>I get it. I think about how much self-work I‚Äôve done in my own life to reply to ‚ÄúI like your X‚Äù with simply ‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù (and not ‚Äúoh, and I like your..‚Äù or ‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs not that great‚Äù).</p>

    <p>I started a new job midweek this week at GitHub, managing their Ruby Architecture team. I love the team‚Äôs mission:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Making it easy for our engineers to create, deliver, and operate best-of-class Ruby and Rails applications, and sharing the best of it with the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also took about 2.5 weeks in between leaving Code for America and starting this job, so I‚Äôm feeling fresh and ready for several weeks of official onboarding, and several months of growing into the role.</p>

<p><strong>Something I learned</strong></p>

<p>GitHub is heavily into written documentation. <a href="https://ben.balter.com/2014/10/07/expose-process-through-urls/">‚ÄúIf it doesn‚Äôt have a URL, it didn‚Äôt happen.‚Äù</a>. And not just cross-referencing, but emoting and emoji-ing, and being, well, <em>extra</em>. Writing and communication has been reinforced <em>a lot</em> during onboarding, more even than the content itself. Which makes sense: if you understand how the organization communicates, you can seek answers independently.</p>

<p><strong>Something I was inspired by</strong></p>

<p>Despite formal onboarding being my number one focus, I‚Äôve been having casual 1:1s with my team. They‚Äôre great! I‚Äôve been inspired by the nuance and understanding they bring to the work. On its own, being a service team is <em>hard</em>, and corporate open source is <em>hard</em>. I‚Äôve found myself heavily nodding along hearing them discuss the challenges of moving people forward. It‚Äôs brought to surface a few thoughts and memories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Of being a frontend lead at Pantheon and the challenges of getting platform-team resources to build up to the outcome and vision we all agreed on, but that had some uncomfortable zigs and zags to get there. A case of make the change easy (which <em>can be hard</em>), then make the easy change.</li>
  <li>My falling out of the Drupal ecosystem as it developed more in line with the needs of full-service agencies than of solo devs and configurers like myself. As one of my colleagues admitted this week, our developers aren‚Äôt running ‚Äúrails new‚Äù a whole lot and that‚Äôs something to be mindful of how it shapes the contributions.</li>
  <li>‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre leading and no one is following, you‚Äôre just out for a walk.‚Äù</li>

<p>A few themes stuck out to me, from my standpoint of 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contemporary development, and even agile (by other names) come from feminized sources.</li>
  <li>The distinctions between the activities of plugging, coding, programming, solving, planning, and training; and the roles of ‚ÄúEngineer‚Äù, or ‚ÄúArchitect‚Äù or ‚ÄúManager‚Äù which are largely gendered.</li>
  <li>The feminization of  ‚Äútechnical‚Äù work of interacting with business machines (e.g. a typewriter, photocopier, etc.) and the perceptual ‚Äúde-skilling‚Äù of those roles despite them being, well, heavily technical.</li>
  <li>Programming productivity gains being gobbled up by increasing complexity‚Ä¶. Well, sometimes‚Ä¶ because there is a perceptual emphasis on complex edge-cases rather than the needs of the ‚Äútypical‚Äù business.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_Software_Engineering_Conferences">Conference on Software Engineering sponsored by NATO and held in Garmisch, Germany on 7‚Äì11 October 1968</a> was a big deal in the history of programming.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sure sounds like contemporary collaborative practices:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Elsie] Shutt‚Äôs [of Comp Inc.] approach was to organize her programmers in teams that collaboratively divided the work among themselves: ‚ÄúWe would get together every week, everybody working on the project. One thing we had to learn to do was to take a job and to break it into pieces‚Äîmeaningful pieces‚Äîand then we‚Äôd get together, talk about it, assign jobs.‚Äù She coached her programmers to be meticulous, which resulted in efficiencies for the company and a better product for the client. For example, she emphasized desk-checking, the practice of having programmers review each other‚Äôs code before running it on the computer. Although desk-checking was a fairly common practice in the 1950s, Shutt believed that she ‚Äúemphasized it more than others did‚Äù because we were doing things that we broke up into more pieces than some people did.‚Äù Comp Inc. had no room for ‚Äúegotistical‚Äù programmers who refused the share their code. Another key priority was ‚Äúdocumenting it‚Äîwell‚Äîso that someone else would be able to maintain it if they needed to.‚Äù Producing modular, well-documented code also made it easier for Comp Inc. to repurpose programs for subsequent clients, which saved on programming costs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‚Ä¶and Agile:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Women may have been uniquely situated to participate in these innovations because of their gendered role in the workplace. As working programmers‚Äîand as the staff members who stereotypically were asked to assist customers or in-house users‚Äîwomen had both the expertise to devise solutions and the incentive to make programming easier for experts and novices alike. And although women usually lacked the formal authority to impose workplace practices, this was unnecessary in a computer culture that left the choice of techniques largely up to programmers themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On productivity and the never-realized goal of getting rid of programming as a specialization:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In many ways, the campaign for automatic programming was a rousing success: The new techniques were widely adopted, and as promised, they greatly reduced the time that was needed to produce programs and  transferred much tedious work from humans to machines. Many programmers took advantage of these new tools to improve the organization of that programs, creating a visible, logical structure that made code faster to produce and easier to maintain, reuse, and share. However, to the disappointment of some, the overall effect of compilers and associated tools was not to eliminate programming but to redefine it. Much of what had been included as an integral part of programming practice‚Äìtedious copying or recoding of subroutines, the need to be aware of machine design and physical memory configuration, and the use of machine codes-was no longer required. But the programmer still had to design and specify the higher-level structure of the program, tasks that proved too complex for most end-users. The new techniques also did nothing to automate the initial analysis of the problem‚Äìthe task of modeling a real-world activity as an ordered flow of computable steps. Although this work could potentially be shifted from the programmer to a systems analyst, in either case it was a person and not the computer that performed it.</p>

  <p>To the extent that a factory-like version of automation failed to materialize, it vindicated programmers‚Äô holistic view of their work as complex and creative. It also reflected a conscious decision by computer manufacturers and their customers to use automation to increase productivity and quality rather than to shrink the labor force. Managers asked programmers to tackle more ambitious projects or create more sophisticated user interfaces, expanding their demand for skilled labor to absorb the available supply. The ever increasing complexity of cutting-edge systems would soon lead to new calls for a reform of programming methods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An ongoing discussion about what happens.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The term software engineering has become common enough today that its provocative effect has been lost. Yet when the term was introduced at Garmisch, it was purely aspirational.  Rather than claiming to describe actual practices, the organizers named an ideal that did not yet exist. Nor was it obvious that engineering was the best model for programming. The computing literature of the 1960s is rife with competing metaphors, each or which was chosen to make a particular claim about the nature of programming. Some managers continued to view programming as creative art or craft‚Äîand in a positive sense, rather than as a problem to Be cured by imposing scientific rationality. In the academic community, computer science was often seen as a branch of mathematics, which had a higher intellectual status than engineering. The 1970 <em>On the Management</em> of Computer Programming, a book that targeted a business audience, ignored the new term software engineering and preferred to use managerial skill as its ideal. Maurice Wilkes argued in 1976 that the term <em>engineering</em> did not realistically represent the process of creating a large program. He suggested instead that ‚ÄúThere are some analogies between writing a program and writing a treatise or a paper.‚Äù Computer industry writers invoked a host of other professions to emulate, including accounting (for its certification standards), medicine (for its skilled teamwork and strong professional societies), architecture (as a model for coherent design and precise specification), aviation (for its recognition of the dire consequences of failure), or even cooking (as a time sensitive production process).  <br />
 ‚Ä¶  <br />
Given this gendered status hierarchy, some practitioners‚Äîwomen as well as men‚Äîmay have believed that programmers would rise in stature by adopting the title of engineer. An unintended consequence of this move may have been to make programming and computer science less inviting to women, helping to explain the historical puzzle of why women took a leading role in the first wave of software improvements but become much less visible in the software engineering era.  <br />
‚Ä¶.  <br />
‚ÄúFor instance, getting your requirements right initially; understanding the materials you‚Äôre working with.‚Äù Susan Graham, the daughter of a mechanical engineer, got her Ph.D. in computer science a few years after Garmisch and easily identified as a software engineer.  Referring to the process of checking the semantics of a programming language, Graham characterized engineering practice as trial-and-error: ‚ÄúYou write a compiler, and then you do a lot of testing against real programs, and you try to see whether the right thing happens. And that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs engineer ing!‚Äù These examples demonstrate again the diverse meanings of engineering, as well as female practitioners ability to prioritize those aspects of engineering that matched their own needs, experiences, and values.  <br />
‚Ä¶  <br />
Some aspects of the software engineering ideal appealed directly to preferences that were widely expressed by women, such as the desire to create something that would improve users‚Äô lives. Edward E. David of Bell Laboratories expressed this philosophy at Garmisch in 1968: ‚ÄúSoftware engineering and computing engineering have an extremely important and nice aspect to them, namely that people want to work on things that meet other people‚Äôs needs. They are not interested in working on abstractions entirely; they want to have an impact on the world.‚Äù Mary Shaw, who helped establish Carnegie Mellon University‚Äôs Software Engineering Institute in the 1980s, echoed this public service ethos in her own 1990 definition of engineering as solving ‚Äúpractical problems . . . in the service of mankind:‚ÄùIn her view, key aspects of an ‚Äúengineering attitude‚Äù included ‚Äúconsidering users‚Äù and realizing that design choices had to be made ‚Äúfor both technical and nontechnical reasons.‚Äô Shaw‚Äôs emphasis  on users and on real-word, nontechnical factors fits well with the computer-as-a-tool orientation more common among women. <strong>Although Engineering as a profession has been highly masculine, engineering as a discipline or philosophy has had wider range of potential meaning.</strong>  <br />
‚Ä¶   <br />
<strong>In at least three important senses, software engineering could be said to have failed.</strong> First, because of the divergent approaches and priorities of academic theorists and industry practitioners, much research investment has been wasted. Second, to the extent that software engineering was meant to revolutionize labor practices by deskilling and disciplining programmers, imposing standardized research-based methods, or mandating licensing, it has not succeeded. Finally, software engineering never solved the problem that was its <em>raison d‚Äôetre</em>‚Äîthe software crisis. These failures call into question the notion that engineering is the most appropriate model for the programming profession.</p>
