    <p>I’ve been meaning to type of some of my notes from the NTEN 2008 Conference, but the benefit of waiting is that someone will do it better. Like <a href="http://havefundogood.blogspot.com/2008/03/notes-from-seven-things-everyone-wants.html">Britt Bravo: Notes from The Seven Things Everyone Wants: What Freud and Buddha Understood (and We’re Forgetting) about Online Outreach </a>.</p>

<p>In short (lots more notes and examples in the link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Need 1: To be SEEN and HEARD</strong></p>

  <p>Does your home page make people feel heard? Not many people give money because they read a well word-smithed mission statement. Effective sites and campaigns provide space for people to express themselves. Nonprofits need to truly listen to their supporters and acknowledge what they are saying.</p>

  <p><strong>Need 2: To be CONNECTED to someone or something</strong></p>

  <p>Engage people by connecting to what they (not you!) care about.</p>

  <p>**Need 3: To be part of something GREATER THAN THEMSELVES<br />
**</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>**Need 4: To have HOPE for the future<br />
**</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Doom and gloom, and finger-wagging messages don’t work.</p>

  <p><strong>Need 5: The security of TRUST</strong></p>

  <p>People are starved for a sense of trust in “the messenger.”</p>

  <p>**Need 6: To be of SERVICE<br />
**</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The #1 reason people stop giving to a nonprofit is that they feel like they are being treated like an ATM machine. They want to help, but they want to be of service, and to have different ways of serving. That need is not being fulfilled if all they hear is the unimaginative drumbeat of dollars.</p>

  <p>**Need 7: To want HAPPINESS for self and others<br />
**</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The core of Buddhism is that everyone wants happiness and to be free from suffering. The more you want happiness for others, the better it is for you, and them.</p>
</blockquote>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The cafe down the corner from my house makes the best brownies and I’ve been wanting this recipe ever since they opened. My friends have been quietly debating whether it was corn syrup or condensed milk that makes them so good. I made an oft-hand remark about it today and the counter-girl went back and wrote out the recipe for me. Turns out the answer is butter and eggs, lots of ‘em.</p>

<p>In regard to the amounts below: they were given to me in grams, and I did some loose conversions since I don’t have a scale.</p>

<ul>
  <li>3-1/3 C (760g) Butter</li>
  <li>1-2/3 Lb (910g) Chocolate</li>
  <li>12 Eggs</li>
  <li>2 Tsp Vanilla</li>
  <li>2-1/2 C (560g) Sugar</li>
  <li>3-1/3 C (420g) Flour</li>
  <li>2 Tsp Salt</li>
</ul>

<p>18” X 24” Pan (makes 24 Brownies)</p>

<p>I didn’t get the instructions for actually baking them, but I assume that you melt and cool the chocolate, then cream everything, adding the flour at the end.</p>

<p>Probably bake at 350 (though maybe a cooler 325). They should have a torte-like consistency when done—cakily aerated but moist and fudgy if compressed.</p>

<p>I made a simple chart of approximate seed planting times for Boston (USDA Zone 6). You can <a href="http://island94.org/files/island94.org/Boston%20Vegetable%20Planting%20Chart.pdf">download a printable PDF of the planting chart</a>.</p>

<p>Today I put together a simple raised bed in my backyard. I built it along the same design as the <a href="http://www.thefoodproject.org/agriculture/Internal1.asp?ID=601">Food Project’s Build-a-Garden Program’s planter</a>—which my landlord participated in last year. Other than shoveling 1300 pounds of soil needed for an 8 x 4 raised bed, it was pretty easy. The only really novel part is putting a sheet of weed-block between the ground and the planting soil to keep the vegetables from growing down into polluted city-dirt.</p>

  <li>4 green onion, chopped</li>

  <li>Put into blender or food processor.</li>
  <li>Add garlic.</li>

  <li>Add 4 green onions and cilantro.</li>
  <li>Simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>

<p><em>My alteration</em>:</p>

<p>Take all of the above ingredients, and just throw them in a blender (I use a can of whole stewed tomatoes rather than the fresh tomatoes—probably better fresh). Done._</p>

<p>Meet my new cat, Jose Pierpont (“Ponty”). I got him a few weeks ago from the MSPCA and he’s somewhere in that adolescent cat phase between 10 months and a year old. He’s pretty awesome, though he has a strong penchant for pipe cleaners. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bensheldon/sets/72157604097747478/">more pictures</a></p>

<p>Two weeks ago I launched a new website at <a href="http://brompt.com" title="a blog reminder service">Brompt.com</a>. It’s a web-based service for unreliable bloggers (like myself) that sends you an email if you haven’t posted to your blog in a while. It’s sort’ve like <a href="http://www.hassleme.co.uk/">HassleMe</a> except Brompt actively scans your blogs RSS feed to only send reminders when you’re lax (as opposed to just sending you a reminder every so often).</p>

<p>It’s very practical, but I also think Brompt is really interesting conceptually too. Everyone talks about RSS as just a means to aggregating <em>content</em>, but there is so much other interesting metadata in an RSS feed too.</p>

<p>Right now the site is just the barebones service, but I’m planning on adding some statistics and such so you can track your unreliability. It’s a fun project with a lot of possibilities.</p>

    <p>Because of constructive criticism of some of my organization’s archaic language, I <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Mission-Based-Massachusetts/message/2096">asked</a> the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Mission-Based-Massachusetts/">Mission Based Massachusetts Listserv</a>, a nonprofit discussion list, what terms they use in place of “poor people”. Below are all of the responses I got, which were awesome!</p>

<p><strong>Some terminology…</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>low-income</li>
  <li>under-resourced</li>
  <li>under-served ( <a href="http://www.childrensroom.org">Barbara</a> humorously notes that “overserved” is a euphemism for intoxicated)</li>
  <li>people living in poverty</li>
  <li>historically and persistently marginalized groups</li>
</ul>

<p>(thanks <a href="http://www.healthq.org">Michelle</a>, <a href="http://organizerscollaborative.org">Felicia</a>, and others who are quoted below)</p>

<p><strong>Some general strategies…</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a preposition: Instead of “poor children” the phrase “children from low income households”. Therefore, it’s not the subject themselves, but rather their circumstances. (thanks <a href="http://www.childrensroom.org">Barbara</a>!)</li>
  <li>Use a specific measure, like “125% of the federal poverty threshold” or “50% of area median income,” whatever’s most appropriate in the context.</li>
  <li>For a grant proposal, look at the language the grantmaker is using and follow their lead. (thanks <a href="http://caasomerville.org">Dennis</a>!)</li>
  <li>Think of the program as asset based rather than deficit based: people who benefit end up being associated with the problem and not the solution (thanks <a href="http://homeinc.org">Alan</a>!).</li>
  <li>“Describing the populations we want to serve as ‘marginalized’ or ‘most vulnerable’ makes our donors feel good about themselves, but at the risk of objectifying people, using a dominant culture’s description of them as somehow Other. We try to incorporate this awareness into our outreach materials by assuming that the people we serve will be reading the materials. How would they feel about this description? How would they describe themselves? Does a description assume that the people have brought their situation on themselves? Does it assume that the people are simply victims and not actors in their lives? Does the language carry implicit judgment? Calling an activity ‘drug abuse’ carries many more judgments and assumptions than calling it ‘drug use.’ (thanks <a href="http://www.ccaa.org">Kathy</a>!)</li>
</ul>

<p>“‘Working poor is a helpful phrase for those who are working, which reminds people that we aren’t talking about ‘welfare queens’, a term I fear may still have resonance….I like to remind people what the actual Federal Poverty Guidelines are. We know, but many people outside our profession don’t actually know how low it is, and if you take a minute and ask people to think about how it compares to their own household income, you can see people digest what that means.” (thanks <a href="http://caasomerville.org">Michelle</a>!)</p>

<p><em>To note, from the <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/08poverty.shtml">2008 Federal Poverty Guidelines</a>, an individual making less than $10,400 is in poverty, while for a household of 4 poverty is earning less than $21,200 (in the lower 48 states, slightly more in Hawaii and Alaska). As of 2006 there were 36.5 million Americans in poverty (according to the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/poverty06/pov06hi.html">US Census Bureau</a>).</em></p>

<p><strong>Some said that the terminology wasn’t the issue…</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“I’m poor. It doesn’t upset me when people say I’m poor. It does upset me when the thought police waste everyone’s time talking about language issues instead of actually fighting poverty.” (thanks Pat!)</li>
  <li>“There’s nothing degrading about saying someone is poor. It’s an insult only if you believe their poverty indicates their own moral failing, and THAT’s an antiquated attitude.” (thanks <a href="http://caasomerville.org">Dennis</a>!)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>And a related example…</strong></p>

<p>“This is interesting to me because I work at a prison education organization. We have lots of materials that talk about ‘prisoners’. An ex-prisoner recently called that word into question, saying that it was dehumanizing and he preferred to be referred to as a person (perhaps incarcerated person?). However, I work with a group of folks who deliberately call themselves Ex-Prisoners. So there’s no easy answer.” (thanks <a href="http://www.partakers.org">Mea</a>!)</p>

<p><strong>External Resources:</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://providers.org">Michael</a> pointed me to two great resources:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.providers.org/mediaresources/twopennyproject.html">Two Penny Project: To build public support for human services in Massachusetts</a>: “…The problem with the Sympathy/Poverty frame is that it reinforces the idea that poverty is the result of bad individual choice rather than a condition that requires systemic reform. This message also recreates the sense that people will think nothing can be done that doesn’t make matters worse….The Ford Foundation recommends that advocates frame their messages in terms of responsible planning and economic vision, with a strong secondary or reinforcing message about community planning….” (page 3)</li>
  <li><a href="http://economythatworks.com">For An Economy That Works</a>: There are a lot of resources and studies here on language. Their goal is creating effective frames of reference for poverty issues to effect policy, which may or may not be applicable to grantwriting or appeals.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Interesting article entitled <a href="http://peternbiddle.wordpress.com/2008/03/26/trust-isnt-transitive-or-someone-fired-a-gun-in-an-airplane-cockpit-and-it-was-probably-the-pilot/">Trust Isn’t Transitive (or, “Someone fired a gun in an airplane cockpit, and it was probably the pilot”)</a> about a recent accidental/negligent discharge in a 747 by a pilot’s gun:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s look at this quote from the article in question, attributed to Mike Boyd: “if somebody who has the ability to fly a 747 across the Pacific wants a gun, you give it to them.” This is a horribly flawed assumption, because it assumes that trust is transitive, when clearly it isn’t.</p>

  <p>The reason trust isn’t transitive is because trust is most often based on data regarding the past which allows us to make assumptions about specific competence, quality of performance, and behaviors in the future.</p>

  <p>We can assume that a trained pilot, when facing piloty thingies, will act like a trained pilot. WE CANNOT ASSUME THAT A TRAINED PILOT WILL ACT LIKE A TRAINED LION-TAMER WHEN FACING A WILD LION.</p>

  <p>Skills from one domain cannot simply be moved from that domain to another</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And the great example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…many pilots will tell you that jet pilots are much more like to die on a motorcycle than they are on a plane, because they act stupid on motorcycles.</p>

    <p>Brief article on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/jobs/06career.html?em&amp;ex=1207713600&amp;en=fd9380b8e8715fe9&amp;ei=5087%0A">getting a nonprofit job</a> from the NY Times</p>

<p>Q. What are the biggest misconceptions about switching from the corporate world to the nonprofit world?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A. Many people are surprised to find the hours longer and stress greater than in the corporate world. Brian Olson, who left the private sector for a nonprofit in 2006, found the decision-making process to be unfocused.</p>

  <p>“No matter how good a volunteer board is, it’s not the same as a corporate board, because everyone has a different agenda,” said Mr. Olson, who returned to the private sector a year later to be vice president for public affairs at Video Professor Inc., a company in Lakewood, Colo., that sells self-tutorial programs. “There was a purity to corporate life I missed,” he said.</p>

  <p><strong>There is value, he said, to “a company just getting the job done based on the needs of the marketplace.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Makes me think of my friend’s snarky t-shirt idea: “Get a Nonprofit Career: Make a difference in someone’s life. Your own.” or simply “Nonprofit jobs let you feel good about yourself”.</p>
