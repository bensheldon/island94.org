<p>I was over at my pal Dean’s place in Jamaica Plain today. In addition to lots of semi-expired foodstuffs he snags from behind the Co-Op next door, he also has the screens and materials for t-shirt printing. Previously I had been helping him up in Lowell filming some promos for his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060321152358/http://www.getdemocracy.com/">Democracy Player</a> channel, “Telemusicvision”:http://telemusicvision.com; today we were putting stuff on t-shirts.</p>

<p>The design I decided to print was one of the doodles I had done a week or so ago for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030214001714/http://digitalbicycle.org:80/">DigitalBicycle Project</a> while waiting for Jessica to get done with her homework .</p>

<p>The process basically was:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Clean off a screen, which is a fine mesh in a wooden frame</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mix together the emulsion, which is a bunch of thick green stuff, with a little bit of yellow photo sensitive hardener. Apparently on their own they like to stain, and together they really like to stain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scrape this emulsion concoction on the screen very thinly, but enough to fill in the mesh. Let dry a few hours in Dean’s oven—it wasn’t turned on, just a good out of the way place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Print the design out onto a transparency. It has to be monotone-mesh doesn’t do gradients. I tried to get to those little halftone circles like Lichtenstein, but Adobe Illustrator was having none of it-I had designed the thing in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060812120129/http://www.inkscape.org:80/">Inkscape</a>, my preferred drawing program and was working off a PNG.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get the (now) dried emulsion convered screen. It is photosensitive—not sensitive like photographic paper, but just don’t point a spotlight at it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lay it down on something black, in our case a t-shirt—this keeps reflections from hitting the underside; place the transparency on top and then we dropped a piece of glass over that, just to keep it flat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shine a hundred watt light on it for about 40 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The light hardens the emulsion. So after it’s been hardened, take the screen in the bath and spray warm water on it, which will wash any emulsion from the screen that was covered by the design—since this was blocked by the light and thus not hard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tape off any non-emulsion filled parts that aren’t part of the design</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put on top of t-shirt and now scrape some special black paint over it. Lift off and voila. Our screen wasn’t perfect, so we had to use a q-tip with paint on the end to touch up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let the paint dry. This being Massachusetts in March, we put it on top of a space heater for an our</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lastly, you have to iron the design on the shirt, letting the iron heat each part for about 60 seconds. This somehow “proofs” the paint so that it won’t run in the wash.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rock it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

    <p>Lately I’ve been spending more time than I should with a great free/open source software illustration program: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060812120129/http://www.inkscape.org:80/">Inkscape</a>.</p>

<p>Before I get to far into an explanation of the fun and wonder I have with Inkscape let me make a little caveat. I’ve used Adobe Illustrator in the past and never liked it much; I admit though that I never really knew how to use it well.</p>

<p>With Inkscape–it’s available for Windows, Mac and Linux–I am very quickly and easily recreate the simple doodles I make during staff meetings. The tools ar quite simple and with a little bit of practice you’ll be making smooth shapes, clean gradients and surprisingly nice art. Seriously.</p>

<p>Inkscape is a vector drawing program, which means that you are creating basic shapes, and then deforming the shapes themselves <em>mathematically</em>. This is different from raster or bitmap drawing programs like MS Paint, Photoshop or The GIMP, in which you are modifying pixels. What the hell am I talking about? Basically, if you’ve ever tried to enlarge a image in Photoshop and had it turn into a grainy mess, you won’t have this program with drawings made and enlarged in Inkscape.</p>

<p>Another plus of Inkscape is that there are lots of great Public Domain/Creative Common graphics on the internet in Inkscape’s native format: SVG. This is doubly cool because once you get your mind around the idea that these graphics can be scaled and still look great, it’s no trouble at all to make ants eating houses or whatever scale destructing things strike your fancy. All with no blocks or jagged edges in sight.</p>

<p>I included an image I’ve recently done below. The graphic of the videocassette is public domain that I got from openclipart.com.</p>

I was in New York a few weeks ago for work/pleasure and stayed at my old roommate Greg’s place near 47th and Lexington. I snapped this one while coming back from B&amp;H Photo where I talked on a panel about digital media distribution.</p>

<p>I commute by train to work every morning. Normally in Lowell the siderails are filled with boxcars. This morning they had left, but not without leaving evidence.</p>

<p>Jess and I were up at MIT to see a friend and coworker in a MIT Community Players production of Autobahn, a series of 7 one-act plays taking place in the front seat of an automobile, by Neil Labute. She was great, the plays themselves were ok and a little redundant by the end.</p>

<p>Leaving the building we had to tread through some relatively thick snow. We tried to follow the footprints of others, though as the photo shows, some of them were a little less than efficient at getting anywhere.</p>

<p>I snapped this photo just this morning. Lowell, America’s Venice is crossed with canals that have just started to freeze over. The leaky drainpipe is keeping the ice from fully freezing, and the tree is still holding on to some of its leaves.</p>

Jess and I were out with her coworker Liz and fiance Adam tonight when we heard this gem for the first time. We were talking about all sorts of <em>blending</em>: back acne: backne; gigantic-enormous: ginormous, smother- suffocate: smufficate. How appropriate that we were eating out at Jose McIntyres: an eclectic and moderately edible mix of Irish pub and Mexican food.</p>

<p>This evening I headed up to the Somerville Central Public Library and checked out the opening exposition of the Somerville Mapping Project, on display through the end of December. It was awesome.</p>

<p>All kinds of individuals, young and old, mapped out on poster board some things that they identified with, liked, disliked, or perhaps just wanted to share with others. There were old photos from the Blizzard of ‘79 and of mom-and-pop stores driven out of business by regional retailers; news articles and notes. These were connected with colorful string or pipe cleaners to their geographical locations on base maps of Somerville.</p>

<p>In addition to these individual projects, everyone collaborated together on one large map, maybe 7 feet square, and mapped out everything from mailboxes, to empty lots and favorite spots in Somerville. There were some really neat cutouts where you could see some locations at different times of the day.</p>

<p>Most exciting of all though was the use of audio recordings. CD players were lent out at the door and you could walk around listening to different people discussing their maps and their community. Little pictures of headphones and number on maps alerted you to set that track on the CD player to listen to an audio accompaniment.</p>

<p>There was a great turnout of community members and some delicious food at the exposition. I was greatly impressed as well with the level of inclusiveness: all of map explanations were translated in English, Spanish and Portuguese. A Spanish translator was in attendance as well and wove in and out of the speeches and recruitment calls made by the organizers at SNC (Somerville Community Corporation) and ESNC (East Somerville Neighbors for Change)</p>

<p>I am glad I went and found a lot of great ideas for the community mapping project I’m organizing in Lowell.</p>
