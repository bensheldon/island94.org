The management class is used to experiencing the world through the *artifacts of work*.

LLMs produce the artifacts of work without humans producing the associated institutional value and advancement of that work.

The LLM sleight of hand operates in the gap between management inputs and work outputs, making it possible (and likely) for managers to see low value *artifacts as proof of work*, and see *work as waste*.
