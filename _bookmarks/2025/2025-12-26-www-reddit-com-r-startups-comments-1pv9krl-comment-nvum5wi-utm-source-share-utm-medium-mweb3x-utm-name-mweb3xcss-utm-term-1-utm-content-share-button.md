Let's be honest. You don't care. Customers aren't your concern and neither is any kind of business reality. You want to build this. You also want somebody to tell you to go ahead with this, despite economic and market realities.

Okay. Build it. Just don't expect sales.

People who dislike business go ahead and start one all of the time. This forum isn't even about business, it is about building something then forcing it down the throat of someone who doesn't want to buy. These people post their shock at launching to the sound of crickets -- despite knowing better -- all of the time here.

Because this isn't a business forum. It is a refuge for those hiding from business realities.
