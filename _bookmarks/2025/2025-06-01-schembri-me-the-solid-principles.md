To summarise, I don't think the SOLID principles are that important, or relevant, in today's world.

I do think that the practice of reading about SOLID, or any other software principles, can help lubricate the old brain cogs and help us think more about the design of our software. That's absolutely worth doing.

But applying SOLID? Nah. There are too many ifs, buts, and maybes to qualify it all.
