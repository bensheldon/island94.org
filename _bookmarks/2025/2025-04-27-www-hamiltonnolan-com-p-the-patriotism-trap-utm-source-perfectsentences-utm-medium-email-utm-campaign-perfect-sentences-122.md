> Liberalism, with its embrace of universal values and the rights of mankind, has never truly prevailed in America because most of its alleged advocates have not been willing to release their grasp on patriotism. For fascists, patriotism is a door to pass through; for liberals, it is a wall. They should walk around it, but instead they continue to bang their heads against it. It makes liberals look pathetic, scared of their own conclusions. “We, ah, don’t support the war, but we support the troops, and we certainly support the pilot of the bomber, as an American, but we don’t support the bombs themselves, although we do support the company that makes the bombs, since it’s a pillar of the American economy, but we hope that the bombs don’t kill anyone innocent, but we still hope that American wins the war, though we know the war is unjust, because we love America.”
