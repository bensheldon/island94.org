The humane part of the software development craft always appealed to me more than anything else. But this part exposes itself only over time. Let’s put it this way: a reasonably dedicated developer can implement any reasonable idea in any first way they think of. Like, you can convey urgent news or a fresh thought in the roughest, most incoherent words, and still pass the information.

But for an idea to live, for a project to evolve, to preserve velocity and maintainability, you need something more. Some ways for all of it to continue make sense. I say it in the most pragmatic way: a growing and ever-changing system like a software project needs a way to maintain coherence and not fall apart. Even developing the most pedestrian features and performing the most mundane refactorings, I never stop thinking about the ways we convey messages and preserve truth. I continue to learn. I continue to try to share my experience.

I don’t know if what I am saying makes sense right now.
