Quite simply, these services are slot machines for content. They’re playing probabilities: when you ask a large language model a question, it returns answers aligned with the trends and patterns they’ve analyzed in their training data.1 These platforms do not know when they get things wrong; they certainly do not know when they get things right. Assuming an “artificial intelligence” platform knows the difference between true and false is like assuming a pigeon can play basketball. It just ain’t built for it.
