> Assuming everything is well behaved and you have a reasonable parser for PDF objects this is fairly simple. But you cannot assume everything is well behaved. That would be very foolish, foolish indeed. You're in PDF hell now. PDF isn't a specification, it's a social construct, it's a vibe. The more you struggle the deeper you sink. You live in the bog now, with the rest of us, far from the sight of God. If your parser expects files to obey the specification it will fail and people will think it is broken and pitiable. They will think that you are very silly.
