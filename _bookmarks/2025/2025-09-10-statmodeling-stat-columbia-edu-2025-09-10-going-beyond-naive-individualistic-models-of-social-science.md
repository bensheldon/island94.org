> What we have to do . . . is to go beyond the individualistic approach to survey sampling. Traditionally you ask a person about themselves, maybe about their family, and thatâ€™s it, as if each respondent or each household lives in a little bubble. There is such a thing as society, and we can ask people all sorts of things about who they know, what their friends do, and so forth. We can ask whatever we want!
