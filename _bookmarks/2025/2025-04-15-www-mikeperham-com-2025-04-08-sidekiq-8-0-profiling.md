> Profiling is one of those skills that requires a mental model which is hard to teach in a blog post. Try out the profiling functionality, play with the Firefox Profiler UI and you’ll start to understand the data and what’s happening. Open an issue if you have a problem or if we can improve something. Good luck and happy profiling!
