Ah, we have an editorial standard here: The “to be sure” paragraph. The members of the Post’s opinion page cannot just praise football. They have to let you know that they understand this sport, at once brutal and beautiful, precise and physical, turns the brains of the people playing it to mush, and also that the very specific game that reminded them how much they love football opened with one player spitting on another.

Yes! The first player the Post mentioned in its editorial about how much they love the NFL was a guy they chastised for being a bad role model. What a sport!
