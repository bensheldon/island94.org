> Life is never cleanly sorted into victims and villains. You can be both. People and events wounded you, and you’ve written around that pain in metaphor, circling it rather than naming it or taking us through it. Give us the scenes. Give us the exact words. Show us what happened rather than relying on the feeling-memory alone. Don’t aim for readers to sympathize with you; tell them in detail (Quotes! Actions! Sensations!) what you went through, and trust that it was bad enough (it was) that you don’t need to persuade them. Maybe they'll sympathize. Maybe they won't. They will respect you for the clarity.
