The project's founders have many years of experience in a now-defunct Philadelphia nonprofit that was dedicated to helping expand access to public benefits like SNAP and Medicaid.

One crucial ingredient for expanding benefits access is helping people to quickly assess their eligibility for the programs.

This project aims to make it easier to create these assessment tools, to the point where it can be done by savvy subject matter experts with little-to-no formal software coding training.
