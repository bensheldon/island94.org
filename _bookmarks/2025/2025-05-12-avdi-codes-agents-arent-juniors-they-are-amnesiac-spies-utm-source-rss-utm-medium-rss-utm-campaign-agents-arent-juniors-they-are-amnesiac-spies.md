title: Agents Aren't Juniors, They Are Amnesiac Spies

Postscript: Unlike a spy though, the agent is terrible at getting itself out of sticky situations. If it can’t “figure out” (pattern-match) why a test is failing it’ll add more and more code and eventually slime the tests. Even if I’ve explicitly forbidden them to do that. This is a situation in which it shows its lack of self-awareness—another trait that makes it distinctly un-junior-like.
