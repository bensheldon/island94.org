Just once I'd appreciate someone writing an article in a mainstream pub that details both the political economy of AI and the more complex and nuanced usages on college campuses.

This article doesn't focus on an issue of political economy and lacks any sort of nuance about its usages on college campuses.

The end result just reads like a marketing strategy.
