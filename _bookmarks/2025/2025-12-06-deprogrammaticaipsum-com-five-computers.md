> Since the dot com crash of 1999-2001, investors have looked to seed companies with the smallest amount of money possible to lead to either a rapid collapse or rapid growth supported by multiple follow-on investment rounds until an eventual exit. Hockey-stick charts, “disruption”, “MVPs”, “growth hacking”, “fail fast” are not neutral business advice, but a particular way of working designed to minimise risk and maximise payoff for a small clique of rich investors who expect the money they lend out to work its way back into the system – perhaps through cloud subscription fees paid to companies they hold positions in. Don’t go buying expensive capital investments like offices, desks or computers when you can rent them…from us.
