> First, this looks wrong because with Poisson and negative binomial regressions, you’ll typically get similar point estimates but a wider standard error for the negative binomial. But here the point estimates are much different, and something seems wrong with the standard errors: the negative binomial has tiny standard errors. And again the p-values don’t match the numbers in the table. The estimates in the first two columns of Table A8 are a stunning (one might say, suspicious) 10+ standard errors from zero, but they’re starred as not reaching the 1% level of significance.
