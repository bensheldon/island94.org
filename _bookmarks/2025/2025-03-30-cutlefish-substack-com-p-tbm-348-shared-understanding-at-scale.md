There's a well-established principle in control systems and human factors design: views must be coupled to the task. A "picture of everything" isn't useful unless it helps the operator do something specific. The failure mode is not a lack of data, it's mismatched context and role-agnostic framing.

There is no universal big picture, only role-specific, moment-specific views that are good for a particular purpose. The dream of a single, unified, evergreen dashboard is seductive but misleading. Clarity comes from designing views that serve a specific job and ensuring people know when and how to use them.
