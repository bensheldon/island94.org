My humble suggestion is: donâ€™t do it. As I have outlined above, I believe there to be one - and only one - reason to use that architecture, and that is reducing the API surface of ActiveRecord. Such reduction can be useful if you have a large and growing number of teams which are going to collaborate on the codebase, and you know that those teams will prefer to work in separate, completely isolated modules.
