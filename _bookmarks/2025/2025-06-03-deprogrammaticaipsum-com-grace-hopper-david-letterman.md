> My vision of a world with computers is a world in which people have a lot more time to do what they like, to do what they want to do and read the books they want to read. It won’t make books obsolete, it’s too tiring to read on computers. Playing tennis, jogging… they’ll have plenty of time to go to the shore. I’d go over to the library and start digging through books. I could do my work at home. I could have a computer at home and talk to my office. I could live up on top of a nice mountain in New Hampshire and smell pine trees and it would be the same as if I were here in the sub-sub-subbasement of the Pentagon.
