title: Milestones As Talking Points
tags: []
---

> what clicked for me recently is that milestones aren’t really about breaking down projects — they are a tool specifically designed for stakeholder communication. If I think of milestones not as arbitrary divisions of a project, and instead as talking points for status updates, that shift in framing gives me something I can use. It gives me criteria for evaluating what makes a good milestone vs a bad milestone, and another lens on how to craft good project status updates. Now that I can see a clear purpose for them, maybe milestones aren’t that bad after all.
