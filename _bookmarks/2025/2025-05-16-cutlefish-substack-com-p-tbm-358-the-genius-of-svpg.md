Themes like competence, bravery, vision, and strong leadership sound like challenges, but they're identity-affirming for executives. Transformed lets the leader stay the hero of the change story, and challenges the org without directly threatening the leader's self-image. Change is often about creating conditions where people can negotiate with their self-identity and still find a path forward.

"You're the kind of leader who takes product seriously."

"This is what great companies do, and you aim to be great."

"You already care about this. Here's how to do it better."

And all the while, Cagan is telling teams, "You're not crazy; this is how it's supposed to work."

Genius. SVPG is genius.
