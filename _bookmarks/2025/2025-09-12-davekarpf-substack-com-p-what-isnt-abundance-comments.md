> If we're taking the position that words ought to have meanings, then I am obliged to balk at the use of "syncretic" here. Syncretism ought to mean the conjoining of two or more disparate religions, belief systems, or doctrines into a *coherent* whole. But the point of this post seems to be that "Abundance" is just a bag of random stuff with the word "Abundance" stamped on it. If we're being charitable, that is perhaps eclectic; but syncretic it ain't.
